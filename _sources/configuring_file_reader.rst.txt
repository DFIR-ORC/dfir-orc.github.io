Configuration file reader
-------------------------

ORC tools read XML Config files without relying on the host system’s installed XML parsers by using its own internal/static parser. 
This XML config file can be passed to the tool using the /config switch:
.. code:: bat
    
    GetThis.exe /config=GetThisConfig.xml

To ease deployment and minimize risk of errors, configuration for tools can also be embedded into the binary ressources.

To embed configuration files into a binary, two methods are available:

In a tool’s resource file (tool.rc), add the line:

::

    <TOOLNAME>_CONFIG   BINARY      "<ConfigFileName>.xml"

Or, a posteriori, you can embed the config file using ToolEmbed:

.. code:: xml

    <toolembed>

    <input>Tool.exe</input>
    <output>ConfiguredTool.exe</output>

    <pair name="<TOOLNAME>_CONFIG" value="res:#tool_config" />
    <file name="tool_config" path="ToolConfiguration.xml" />
    
    </toolembed>

Upon startup, tools will locate their associated <TOOLNAME>_CONFIG resource to find their configuration in resource. 

.. note:: no temporary files are created and configuration xml is read directly from the resource.
