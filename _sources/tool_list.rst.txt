*  GetSectors: Collects MBR, VBR and partition slack space 

*  GetThis: Collects sample data from the FileSystem (Files, ADS, Extended Attributes, ...) 

*  NTFSInfo: Collects NTFS meta data (File entries, timestamps, file hashes, authenticode data, etc..) 

*  ObjInfo: Collects the named object list (named pipes, mutexes, ...)

*  RegInfo: Collects registry related information (without mounting hives)

*  USNInfo: Collects USN Jounal
