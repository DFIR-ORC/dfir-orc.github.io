Configuring the yara scanner
----------------------------

FastFind, RegInfo and GetThis can use libyara to scan for matches on disk. 

This scan can be configured with a <yara /> element :
    | <yara
    |      `source <#anchor-yara-source>`_
    |      `block <#anchor-yara-block>`_
    |      `overlap <#anchor-yara-overlap>`_
    |      `timeout <#anchor-yara-timeout>`_
    |      `scan_method <#anchor-yara-scan-method>`_
    | />


.. code:: xml

    <yara source="IOC.yara" block="2M" timeout="120" overlap="8192" />

Attributes that can be used to describe the parameters:

.. anchor-yara-source_::

* **source**
    
    Comma (or semicolon) list of yara files. These can be actual file names or refererences to embedded ressources
    
    Example: source=”res:#MyYaraContent”

* **block**

    Size of the granularity for yara scan. Files will be scanned in blocks of this size.
    
    Example: block=”2M”

* **overlap**

    Size of the overlapping block created to scan for content that may match bytes in the region between two blocks.
    
    Example: overlap=”4K”

* **timeout**

    Time out for the scan. After this amount of *seconds*, the scan will be aborted.
    
    Example: timeout=”120”

* **scan_method**

    When reading large files, we can them in blocks or as one big chunk of data. Select:
        - “blocks” to scan in blocks 
        - “filemapping” to use a pagefile backed filemapping of the file. 

    Example: scan_method=”Blocks”

    .. note:: Please note that the “filemapping” option allows to scan for rules using the file size or the hash of the entire file (but consumes much more process working set)
