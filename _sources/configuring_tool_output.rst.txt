Configure tools’ output
-----------------------

Tools configure their output in a unified way.
The syntax is simple and straightforward:
* Command line argument:

    ::

        /out=<My output>

* Config file XML statement:

    .. code-block: xml

        <output>MyOutput </output>

Where <My Output> can be a file (typically CSV), a directory, an archive or a connection string to a database server.

.. note:: "out" in /out can vary from tool to tools typically for tools with more than one output like ntfsinfo (see MyTool.exe –h for details).


File output
```````````

The simplest form of output:

.. code:: bat
    
    MyTool.exe /out=c:\temp\foo.csv
    
    C:\temp must exist, be a directory and writeable.
    Foo.csv must not exist.

Directory output
````````````````

Directory output takes the form:

.. code:: bat

    MyTool.exe /out=c:\temp\test

    C:\temp\test must exist, be a directory and writeable.

Archive output
``````````````

The simplest form of output for an archive is:

.. code:: bat

    MyTool.exe /out=c:\temp\foo.zip

    C:\temp must exist, be a directory and writeable.
    foo.zip must not exist.

The archive format is selected based on extension of foo:
* Foo.zip selects the zip format.
* Foo.7z selects the LZMA/7zip format (www.7zip.org).
* Foo.cab select the MSCF Microsoft cabinet format.
* Foo.<ext> selects the format if supported in 7zip library for archive creation.

The following tools support output in archive files:
* NTFSInfo
* USNInfo
* GetThis
* GetSamples

SQL Server output
`````````````````

The simplest form of SQL server output is:

.. code:: bat
    
    MyTool.exe /out=<MySQLConnectionString>#<MyTable>

<MySQLConnectionString> must be a valid connection string:

::

    Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;Trusted_Connection=True;DSN=myDsn
    <MyTable> must be an existing table with the appropriate column definition

File character encoding
```````````````````````

To reduce output file size and ease file analysis on Linux systems (that seems to have issues with UTF16), the default encoding for CSV is  now UTF8.
The command line options /utf8 and /utf16 can be used to explicitely control the output encoding.
Also, XML configuration files elements outputfile and outputdir can have an optional attribute “encoding”:

.. code:: xml

    <output encoding="UTF16">c:\temp</output>
  
Or

.. code:: xml
    
    <output encoding="UTF8" >c:\temp\test.csv</output>
