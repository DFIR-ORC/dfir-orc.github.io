Referencing resources in configurations
=======================================

Syntax
------

The section :ref:`architecture-config-process` explains the embedding of tools as resources of configured and unconfigured binaries.
To reference an embedded resource, Mothership and WolfLauncher use the syntaxes below. Configuration files rely on these notations.

* For a resource directly available "in clear text" (as opposed to inside an archive like 7zip or cab):

  .. code::

    res:#ressource_name

  For example, the string ``res:#getthis_evt`` references the resource named getthis_evt in the Embed configuration file for Mothership. Such a resource is created by the following :doc:`ToolEmbed` xml configuration:

  .. code::

      <file name="getthis_evt" path=".\%ORC_CONFIG_FOLDER%\GetEvents_config.xml"/>

  See :doc:`ToolEmbed` for more examples.


* To reference a resource via a entry into an archive embedded in Mothership:

  .. code::

    archive_format:#archive_name|resource_name

  For example, the string ``7z:#Tools|autorunsc.exe`` will reference the resource autorunsc.exe in the 7zip archive named Tools. Such a resource is created by the following :doc:`ToolEmbed` xml configuration:

    .. code:: xml

      <archive name="Tools" format="7z" compression="Ultra">
              <file name="autorunsc.exe" path=".\tools\autorunsc.exe"/>
      </archive>

  See :doc:`ToolEmbed` for more examples.


* Lastly, it is possible to invoke one of the embedded tools, e.g. NTFSInfo, by writing ``run=self:#NTFSInfo``. The ``self:#`` string 
  refers to the unconfigured binary used to run WolfLauncher, e.g. ``DFIR-Orc_x86.exe``. Thus, when ``run=self:#NTFSInfo`` is used 
  in configurations, WolfLauncher creates a new process using its unconfigured binary, ``DFIR-Orc_x86.exe`` in our example, and passes it 
  the name of the tool as argument. Hence, the command line of the new process would be ``DFIR-Orc_x86.exe NTFSInfo``, with maybe other arguments added in the configuration. As explained in :ref:`architecture-tools-cli`, such a line runs the embedded tool NTFSInfo.
